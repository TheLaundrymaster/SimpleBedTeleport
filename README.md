# SimpleBedTeleport
Paper/Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.19 which allows teleportation to a player's bed.

Bring in the .jar file named BedTeleport.jar into your plug-ins folder on a paper server.

This plugin is simple and easy to use.

Once a spawnpoint is created by using /bed or /home the player gets teleported to the bed.

If the bed is destroyed the player is then notified on where the last coordinates were of their bed.
